A **README.md** file is an important part of any GitHub repository, as it provides an overview of your project, how to set it up, and other relevant information. Here's an example of a basic README file tailored to your project (static website with HTML, CSS, JS files):

### Example `README.md`:

```markdown
# My Website

Welcome to the **My Website** repository! This is a simple static website with multiple pages, including a main page, contact page, about page, and a 404 error page.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

```

my-website/
├── index.html        # Main page of the website
├── contact.html      # Contact page with information
├── about.html        # About page to introduce the site or company
├── 404.html          # 404 error page for broken links
├── index.js          # JavaScript file for interactivity (if applicable)
├── style.css         # Optional CSS for styling
└── assets/           # Folder for images, fonts, or other assets

````

## Features

- **Main Page**: A welcoming page with links to other sections of the website.

- **About Page**: Provides information about the website or project.
- **404 Page**: A custom error page shown when a broken or incorrect link is accessed.
